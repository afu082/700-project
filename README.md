# Code execution

The steps provided below outline how to execute the code to 
generate the relevant IES output and create a visualisation 
of the luminous intensity distribution.


1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code or your preferred IDE. (You made need to set up an anaconda environment based
on your local IDE set up)
2. Open main.py
3. Navigate to line 527 and locate the equation_inner_lens and equation_outer_lens variables. Follow the commented 
instructions to define your lens shapes
4. Similarly on line 536 you can define the refractive indices of the lens
5. Follow instructions on line 540 to define the number of light rays to be simulated
6. Follow instruction on line 545 to display light ray simulation.
7. Follow instructions on line 560 to plot luminous distribution curve
8. Follow instructions on line 564 to set distance to visualise plot from
9. After applying your settings, go run > run without debugging to execute the code
10. A plot will appear and display graphical information regarding the light distribution
11. The output IES file generated will appear in 700-project > output > output.ies
